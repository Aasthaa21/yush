        <h2>To Yush💌</h2>
        <p>
            I’ve been thinking about us a lot lately, and I just want to say thank you for being with me through it all. These past 2.5 years have shown me parts of myself I didn’t even know existed, and I’ve realized so much about love, trust, and what it means to truly care for someone.
            <br><br>
            There are days when I feel like I’m barely holding it together, but having you by my side makes all the difference. You don’t even know how much your presence calms me, how your words and simple gestures can pull me out of my darkest moments. There’s a comfort in knowing you’re here, no matter what.
            <br><br>
            I know we’re not perfect. We’ve had our fair share of arguments, misunderstandings, and moments of doubt, but each time, we’ve found our way back to each other. And that’s something I don’t take for granted. I want you to know how much I appreciate your patience, your understanding, and how deeply I care for you. I’m not always great at expressing myself, but I hope you know that I’m all in with you. There’s no one else I’d rather share my life with.
            <br><br>
            Here’s to more highs, more lows, and everything in between. I’m here for all of it, as long as it’s with you.
            <br><br>
            Love, <br>Fatty ❤️

    <section id="terms">
        <h3>The Relationship Contract</h3>
        <p>By entering this agreement, I, Ayush Aggarwal, hereby agree to the following Terms and Conditions for being my boyfriend:</p>
        <ul>
            li><b>The Listening Clause</b>: I promise to listen attentively to my partner, even when it’s about things like hungry bellies, video games, football, or hot girls/guys.</li>
            <li><b>The Communication Commitment</b>: I promise to stay in touch every day. No exceptions. Whether it's a text, call, or emoji, you’ll hear from me.</li>
            <li><b>The Support Agreement</b>: I promise to be there for my partner in good times and bad. If you need me, I’ll be there—even if it’s just for a hug or some advice.</li>
            <li><b>The Honesty Pledge</b>: I promise to be truthful at all times, even when it’s hard to say or embarrassing. Honesty is always the best policy.</li>
            <li><b>The Secret Clause</b>: I promise never to hide anything from my partner unless it’s a surprise party, gift, or any other form of good surprise intended for them.</li>
            <li><b>The Attention Clause</b>: I promise to put down the phone, close the laptop, or pause whatever I'm doing when my partner needs me to listen and talk through their problems.</li>
            <li><b>The Priority Rule</b>: I promise to keep my partner at the top of my mind, and share all the important things—big and small—with them first.</li>
            <li><b>The Laughter Clause</b>: I promise to laugh with my partner, never at them (unless they’re doing something hilariously silly).</li>
            <li><b>The Relationship Preservation Rule</b>: I promise to never intentionally do anything to hurt or mess up our relationship. I’ll try my best to make us work.</li>
            <li><b>The Cooking Pledge</b>: I promise to cook something nice for my partner—whether it’s a homemade meal or delivery, as long as you’re fed, I’ve done my part.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Breach of Contract:</b> In the event of a breach of these Terms and Conditions, the injured party has the discretion to impose a suitable (yet reasonable) punishment or “torture,” though mutual understanding and a remedy should be prioritized to restore harmony.</p>
        <p><b>I HEREBY AGREE TO THESE TERMS</b> and promise to uphold this relationship contract to the best of my ability.</p>
